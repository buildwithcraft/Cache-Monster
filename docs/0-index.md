# Installation

To install CacheMonster, follow these steps:

1. Copy the `cachemonster/` folder to your `craft/plugins/` folder.
2. Go to Settings > Plugins from your Craft control panel and install the CacheMonster plugin.
3. Optionally enable Varnish purging in the plugin settings.

## Requirements

This plugin has been tested on Craft 2.6.x and PHP 7.0.x - other version will probably work but have not been checked.
